# FAQ-Chatbot

FAQ-Chatbot is a web application developed using Angular Javascript framework. The application allows you to interact with a chatbot through a chat interface by submitting a question and the chatbot answers with the most relevant information. The interaction is done using dropdown lists for topic of interest selection, Elasticsearch index field selection, the top-k retrieved results and radio buttons as trained deep learning-based model parameters on the following datasets: FAQIRv1.0 [1], Stack-exchange FAQ [2], and more recent Covid-19 FAQ [3].
